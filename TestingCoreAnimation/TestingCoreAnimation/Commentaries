PACING FUNCTIONS:
- Linear
- Ease in, where your animation starts out slowly and then reaches full speed.
- Ease out, where your animation starts out at full speed and then slows as it reaches
its destination value.
- Ease in, ease out, where your animation starts out slow, speeds up in the middle,
and then slows down again as it reaches its destination value; this is the default
behavior.

COLOR
Color fields that you can animate include
- backgroundColor
The layer’s background color.
- borderColor
The color of the layer’s border.
- shadowColor
The color of the layer’s shadow. At the time of this writing, the shadowColor property
is not available on the iPhone.

MOTION
When you want motion on the screen, Core Animation provides rectangles and points in
each layer that you can animate. Motion fields you can animate include
- anchorPoint
The default anchorPoint of a layer is 0.5,0.5, which indicates the center of the
layer is the anchorPoint. If you change the anchorPoint to 0.0,0.0, it will be
located at the bottom-left corner.
- bounds
The bounds property animates the shape of the bounding rectangle. It does not
affect the layer’s position.
- frame
The frame property is not animated in a layer. You can set this parameter and the
layer’s internal value with change; however, you won’t see the actual animation. If
you want to animate a layer’s bounds, that is, its bounding rectangle, use the bounds
property. If you want to change the position, use the position property. On views
and windows, setting frame causes the bounding frame to animate.
- position
Use the position property to move a layer’s position. The position is dependant
upon the anchorPoint property. If you want to center a layer in its parent view,
leave the anchorPoint at the default of 0.5,0.5 and then calculate the center of the
parent view. Listing 2-3 demonstrates how to center the layer.
- zPosition
The zPosition property controls the z-index of the layer. This determines the layer’s
position from front to back. It can be animated to transition one layer on top of
another.

ATTRIBUTES
Each visible characteristic of a layer can also be animated. These are referred to as
attributes because they are the fields that affect the visible attributes of the layer.
Attribute fields that you can animate include
- borderWidth
The borderWidth property sets the width of the border that surrounds the layer.
- cornerRadius
The cornerRadius property sets the radius of the corners of the layer giving the
layer a rounded rectangle look.

VISIBILITY
Layer’s are visible components, but you can determine how visible. Sometimes, you need
to see through partially or completely. You control this with the visibility fields.
Visibility fields that you can animate include the following:
- opacity
The opacity property determines the layer’s opacity. A value of 1.0 sets the layer to
fully opaque, and a value of 0.0 sets the layer to fully transparent. Use values in
between to set just how opaque you want your layer to be.
- hidden
In theory, the hidden property is animatable; however, it’s actually just an On or
Off switch. If you want to animate the visibility of a layer, use the opacity property
instead of hidden.

FILTERS
When used in conjunction with Core Image, Core Animation layers can have complex
filters applied to them by setting one or more of the filter fields. Core Image filters are
not, at the time of this writing, available on the iPhone.
Filter fields that you can animate include the following:
- filters
The filters property is an array of filters that you can apply directly to the layer’s
content. It affects the entire layer, including the border and background.
- compositingFilter
Different from the filters property, the compositingFilter property uses a single
filter as its parameter.
- backgroundFilters
The backgroundFilters property provides a way for you to apply filters to the
layer’s background only.
